A modern React application for processing URLs through an N8N pipeline with real-time status updates and file download capabilities.

## Features

- ðŸš€ **Modern React App**: Built with React 18, TypeScript, and Vite
- ðŸŽ¨ **Responsive Design**: Beautiful UI with Tailwind CSS
- âš¡ **Real-time Processing**: Dynamic status updates during URL processing
- ðŸ”— **N8N Integration**: Seamless webhook integration with N8N workflows
- ðŸ“± **Mobile Friendly**: Fully responsive design for all devices
- ðŸ§ª **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage with Vitest and Testing Library
- ðŸš€ **Vercel Ready**: Optimized for Vercel deployment

## Processing Pipeline

The application processes URLs through the following steps:

1. **Reading File** - Analyzing the provided URL and extracting content
2. **Generating Candidates** - Creating potential solutions based on the content
3. **Generating Optimal Prompts** - Crafting the most effective prompts for the task
4. **Evaluating Prompts** - Testing and scoring each prompt for effectiveness
5. **Selecting Best Candidate** - Choosing the optimal solution from all candidates

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- N8N instance with webhook endpoint

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd stage-planner
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your N8N webhook URL
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser

## Environment Variables

### Required Variables

- `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL`: The URL of your N8N webhook endpoint

### Example Configuration

```bash
N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/process-url
```

## N8N Webhook Integration

### Expected Request Format

The application sends POST requests to your N8N webhook with the following payload:

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com"
}
```

### Expected Response Format

Your N8N webhook should return:

```json
{
  "downloadUrl": "https://example.com/download/processed-file.txt",
  "fileName": "processed-file.txt"
}
```

### Response Fields

- `downloadUrl` (required): URL where the processed file can be downloaded
- `fileName` (optional): Name of the file (defaults to "processed-file.txt")

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run tests with coverage
npm run coverage
```

### Test Coverage

The project includes comprehensive tests for:
- Component rendering and behavior
- User interactions
- API integration
- Error handling
- Responsive design

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Deployment
